An Upper Bound of the Bias of Nadaraya-Watson Kernel Regression under Lipschitz Assumptions
===

This repository contains the code to 


1. Run the numerical simulations contained in the paper "An Upper Bound of the Bias of Nadaraya-Watson Kernel Regression under Lipschitz Assumptions" Tosatto et al. 2020
2. Allows to run user-defined experiments, and to use the bound defined in the paper

Prerequisites
--

We tested the code with `python 3.7`. We used `numpy` and `scipy` for scientific numerical computations, and `matplotlib` 
to render the results of the experiments.
